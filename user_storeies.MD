I want to be able to sign up and see reviews of cheese made by members of the site

I want to be able to write about a cheese I have tried

I want that review to show up when other people look for that cheese

I want to see a main page of all recent cheese reviews

  the reviews can be up to five hundred characters

  the reviews will discuss the cheeses flavor profile
   (http://www.realcaliforniamilk.com/wp-content/uploads/professionals-guide-to-real-california-cheese.pdf)

I want to be able to click on the review and be taken to a page with more information

I want that page to say the name of the cheese, how many 'wheels'(likes) it has, the farm/cheese producer, the type of cheese it is, and the person who reviewed it

  I want to be able to click on the name of the farm and see other cheese that farm has made

  I want to be able to click on the type of cheese and see more cheese that is that type

  I want to be able to click on the user name and see that persons profile

I want the users profile to have their name (if they choose to use one), their location, a list of cheese they like

  clicking on one of the cheeses takes me to that review
